# [College Enrollment by Race based on Macroeconomic Indicators](https://github.com/afifmazhar/Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/Econometrics/College%20Enrollment/Proposal/Time%20Series%20Final.pdf)

I construct a SVAR model based on [Ewing, Beckert, and Ewing 2009](https://github.com/afifmazhar/Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/Econometrics/College%20Enrollment/References/Ewing_Beckert_2009.pdf) that extends the general premise of the paper. The original SVAR model included two macroeconomic indicators (economic growth and inflation); I add unemployment rate to measure how college enrollment by race is affected by macroeconomic shocks measured by impulse response functions (IRF). I find "white" students are less likely to enroll in college in the fall and that "minority" students are more likely to enroll in college in the fall.
