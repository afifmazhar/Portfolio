The rapid industrialization across the United States and a proactive research process on
marijuana has explored the conversation to include recreational marijuana as a sector in statesâ€™
industrial makeup. I provide a quasi-experimental research design to estimate the impact
of recreational marijuana legalization on economic indicators through the cumulative use of
state data before and after policy enactment. The empirical strategy follows a difference-indifferences
framework with staggered adoption of policy approval on a state-level. Using recent
estimator methods that account for treatment effect heterogeneity, the average treatment
effects, stemming causally from the decriminalization of cannabis across states, are three-fold:
First, poverty levels decrease. Second, the real gross domestic product per capita increases.
Third, household income increases. Adjacent literature suggests that the results are due to
transformations of consumer behavior surrounding marijuana use.
