# Econometrics Projects

Welcome to the Econometrics section of my professional portfolio. This section includes a list of relative projects conducted in the realm of econometric modeling
and techniques. Note that some projects are still in progress of being completed. Below lists a rundown of highlights of each project.

## Cannabis Event Study

"Cannabis: Legalization and the Economic Effects"

A staggered adoption design of the difference-in-differences model deployed to understand the effects of marijuana legalization by policy passage. Collected data on GDP, household income, and poverty rates. Analyzed with HTE-robust estimation methods to decipher effects.

## College Enrollment

“College Enrollment by Race based on Macroeconomic Changes”

The University of Texas at Austin, Time Series Econometrics

Multi-variate time series forecasting conducted to analyze the relationship between racial trends in college enrollment and macroeconomic indicators such as economic growth, inflation, and the unemployment rate. 30+ years of collected FRED data was cleaned in Python, transformed in STATA and utilized to generate a vector auto- regressive model (VAR/SVAR) with short/long-term exogenous shocks on each of the variables. 

## Lott and Mustard Replication (re-write)

“Crime Deterrence and Right-to-Carry Handguns”

The University of Texas at Austin, Causal Inference

Replication of Lott and Mustard (1997) to determine causality of passing Right-To-Carry laws across all states and the subsequent effects on 7 crime categories through two-way fixed effects, dummy regressions, OLS (weighted/unweighted) Created statistical tables in R and used contemporary methods of difference-in-difference quasi-experimental research design aimed to combat the controversial analysis provided in the paper.

## Colorado Synthetic Control (re-write and re-analyze)
“Colorado and the Economic Effect of Cannabis: A Synthetic Control Approach”

The University of Texas at Austin, Causal Inference

Economic research (FRED) conducted to determine the causality of the 2014 legalization of cannabis in Colorado and the state’s GDP through quasi-experimental research design (synthetic control method) in 9 categories. Experimental time-series panel data was collected to infer pre/post-treatment effects of the data; plotted visualizations of treatment effect and the gaps in estimators (produced a cumulative paper).
