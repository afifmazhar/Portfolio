# Full Data Science Pipeline Projects

These projects are integrated completely end to end from data collection to data cleaning to data analysis to machine learning application to (if necessary) model deployment/recommendation.
Below lists a quick rundown of each project. Some projects may require their own repository for deployment and those will be linked as well. Please note none of these projects are completed, and are simply in works.

## British Airways Data Science
(WIP) Web scraping, NLP data exploration, and more.

## Detecting and Preventing SIM Swap Fraud in Telecom Networks
(WIP) Use call detail records (CDRs) and Cell Tower Locations to identify SIM swaps. Use supervised learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to classify fraud vs non-fraud. Apply clustering (K-Means, Hierarchial, DBSCAN) to detect suspicious groups of users. Run anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders) to flag potential fraud cases. Use DID (difference-in-differences) or uplift modeling to estimate impact of fraud detection measures. Output in dashboards/reports to highlight business impact.

## The Causal Effect of Online Ads on Sales
(WIP) Use Google Ads public datasets to identify if paid ads provide more sales or would customers have bought the product anyways. Methods include uplift modeling, a/b testing, and regression discontinuity design. Deployment will be a web application that marketers can analyze their campaign data and get causal insights.
