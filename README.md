# Portfolio

Here is a listing of my works, both complete and WIP. A quick rundown of major projects:

## Cannabis Event Study
"Cannabis: Legalization and the Economic Effects"

Used a staggered difference-in-differences model with heterogenous-robust estimators that are prevalent in the literature to understand the effects of marijuana legalization by policy passage. Collected data on GDP, household income, and poverty rates. (Python, STATA)

## Credit Risk
Binary classification model that predicts whether a customer will pay off their loan. Used various models (XGBoost, Decision Trees, Gaussian) and selected XGBoost with 92% accuracy rate. (Python - sci-kit learn)

## Detecting and Preventing SIM Swap Fraud in Telecom Networks (WIP)
(WIP) Use call detail records (CDRs) and Cell Tower Locations to identify SIM swaps. Use supervised learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to classify fraud vs non-fraud. Apply clustering (K-Means, Hierarchial, DBSCAN) to detect suspicious groups of users. Run anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders) to flag potential fraud cases. Use DID (difference-in-differences) or uplift modeling to estimate impact of fraud detection measures. Output in dashboards/reports to highlight business impact.

## The Causal Effect of Online Ads on Sales (WIP)
(WIP) Use Google Ads public datasets to identify if paid ads provide more sales or would customers have bought the product anyways. Methods include uplift modeling, a/b testing, and regression discontinuity design. Deployment will be a web application that marketers can analyze their campaign data and get causal insights.
